      <div class="has-borders">
        <p>One of the most important aspects of our work here at the Playwrights’ Center is creating a space where playwrights are leaders and can shape their artistic experiences to their wants and needs. 2014-15 was an important year for the Center during which we rolled out some bold projects in support of this playwright-driven model. </p>
        <p>In October 2014, we launched a new brand and website to help us better communicate our mission and more deeply engage with member playwrights around the world through enhanced career-advancement and educational resources.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, we met with artistic leaders around and beyond the U.S. to build a network of new-play-producing theaters interested in engaging with the Center and our writers—a group we call the Regulars. This initiative officially launched in summer 2015, advancing our mission to not just develop plays, but to help them find homes on stage.</p>
        <p>Administratively, we achieved a budget surplus for the second year in a row and completed a three-year strategic plan that will guide our work from now through 2018.</p>
        <p>And of course, we developed more than 60 new plays and supported 44 fellows, mentees, apprentices, and Core Writers. You can see more numbers below, and also get to know some of the people who make up the Playwrights’ Center family. Thank you for helping us build a true artistic home that keeps playwrights in the spotlight.</p>

        <p><strong>Harrison David Rivers</strong> says he was thrilled when Playwrights’ Center Producing Artistic Director Jeremy B. Cohen called him with the news he’d been awarded a 2014-15 Many Voices Fellowship. “Thrilled, but not sold.” He had a good job in New York, “a great apartment, a great roommate.” He thought about declining, “until Jeremy said something that changed everything: ‘We really want you here.’ <em>We really want you here</em>: it’s funny how rarely we hear those words—as human beings, let alone as playwrights.” He accepted the fellowship and came to Minnesota. “It was only supposed to be a year,” Harrison says, “but then I fell in love. I fell in love with the Green Line, and the baked potato pizza at Pizza Luce, and ‘Minnesota Nice.’ I fell in love with the theater community, with the talent and bravery and variety showcased on every stage, and with the accessibility of the cities’ artistic leaders. I fell in love with the Playwrights’ Center staff, with feeling taken care of and supported and encouraged. I fell in love with being wanted.” Harrison decided to stay in Minnesota, applying for and receiving the McKnight Fellowship in Playwriting for 2015-16. “The Playwrights’ Center changed my life,” he says.</p>

        <p><strong>Jenny Connell Davis</strong> is a 2013-2016 Core Writer at the Playwrights&#039; Center. During her first Core Writer year, her play <em>Goddess of Mercy</em> was part of the Ruth Easton New Play Series. Reflecting on the experience, she recalls: “I had terrific discussions with my Minneapolis actors, designer, director, and dramaturg; the play changed a great deal over a few days. But the crucial element was the audience&mdash;nothing taught me more about the play and where it stood than the post-show discussion, where I got to hear an audience respond to what they’d just seen.” During her second workshop in 2014, Jenny brought her eleven-month-old son, Gabriel, with her to Minneapolis to work on her play <em>End of Shift</em>. “I think having my son present during the construction of a piece that is so much about ‘lost boys’ really kept me writing from an empathetic place.” Jenny’s play <em>Scientific Method</em> is part of the 2015-16 Ruth Easton New Play Series.</p>

When Karen Hartman received the award for 2014-15, she knew she wanted to bring Taylor to the Center as a collaborating actor on her commissioned play, <em>Roz and Ray</em>. Karen and Taylor have been friends for over ten years but have not been able to work together as often as they would like. “Working with her again feels like home,” Taylor says. The team-up happened at a Theatre Communications Group conference panel, when Taylor listed Karen as one of his playwright friends who he would like to collaborate with. “When I got off the stage,” he says, “She said she had a part for me. It really was that simple.” He has no trouble putting the playwright role aside to act in another writer’s workshop. “It’s a relief, and it’s rejuvenating to play in someone else’s yard.”</p>

      <p>As much as writers love developing work in our theater, let’s be clear: playwrights don’t write scripts for the Playwrights’ Center workshop table&mdash;they write scripts for the stage. A playwright’s job doesn’t end when the workshop ends, so neither does ours. We seek individualized ways of connecting playwrights and their work to producing theaters and universities, supporting both playwrights and theaters in creating long-term, sustainable relationships. During the 2014-15 season, there were 30 productions of Playwrights’ Center-developed plays, at theaters from Minneapolis to London.</p><a href="https://pwcenter.org/sites/default/files/PWC-developed-plays-2014-15.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="img/map.jpg"></a>

        <p>As part of the Visiting Artistic Leaders program, the Center brings in artistic directors from around the country to foster deeper connections between playwrights and producers. One of the artistic directors last season was <strong>Oanh Nguyen</strong>, who joined us from the Chance Theater in California to see Qui Nguyen’s reading of <em>Dust</em>. Oanh’s first time at the Center was an opportunity to learn about the work we do and connect with Qui and playwrights in residence here. There were two readings of Dust; Oanh saw the first reading and then sat in on the rehearsal the next day to better understand Qui’s goals and next steps for the play. Qui and Oanh had known each other before, but had few opportunities to connect. This experience deepened their relationship. “I was so grateful to be there for Qui’s beautiful, funny, and fragile new post-war play about hope, family, and self-worth,” Oanh said.</p>

        <p><strong>Stephanie Fleischmann</strong> developed the musical <em>The Secret Lives of Coats</em> when she was a Core Writer at the Playwrights’ Center. She is now an Affiliated Writer, an initiative that keeps former Core Writers and fellows connected to the Center. In this capacity, she returned in 2014 to workshop <em>Coats</em> in partnership with <a href="http://www.redeyetheater.org/" target="_blank">Red Eye Theater</a>, completing the final elements with composer Christina Campanella before its Red Eye premiere. Stephanie says, “Not only did two of <em>The Secret Lives of Coats</em>’ most moving songs get written during that workshop (in response to the discoveries we made in the room with singers, a music director, and our inimitable director, Hayley Finn), not only did the workshop give the performers an invaluable head start on learning the piece and becoming a true ensemble, but also (and most importantly) the workshop was instrumental in getting the <em>The Secret Lives of Coats</em> to where it needed to be in terms of our understanding of its shape, its momentum, its rhythms— that invisible dimension where music and text come together, readying it for a hugely satisfying dive into production mode.”</p>

        <p>The Playwrights' Center has members from 11 different countries all over the world, from Belgium to Guam to Tanzania. Fortunately, the Center's membership program allows these members to connect with each other through our website as well as our video conferencing technology. Playwrights' Center member <strong>Kieran Carroll</strong> lives near Melbourne, Australia, and regularly attends monthly Member Open Play gatherings via webcam. With a time difference of 17 hours between Melbourne and Minneapolis, Kieran wakes up early Monday morning to join Member Open Play--it’s still Sunday afternoon back in Minnesota--to share his work and provide feedback to other members. Kieran has also been able to connect with theaters and artists outside of Australia through the Center’s website. After responding to a request for play submissions he found on the Center’s opportunities database, he is getting a production of one of his plays in New York City and will be flying there to be part of the rehearsal process. “For an Australian playwright, a theatrical life outside one's own country can feel a very remote possibility,” Kieran says. “Joining the Playwrights’ Center has given me an enormous amount of new energy and wider scope. Its existence has been the pathway to make me feel my own practice has life elsewhere.” </p>

        <p><strong>Sara Nelson</strong> joined the Playwrights’ Center board in 2014. She is VP Creative Director for KNOCK, Inc., the agency the Center partnered with on the new brand and website. Asked about what the Playwrights’ Center means to her, she replied, “I recently heard something that stuck with me: The dose of dopamine we receive with each smartphone alert is often followed by a crash in mood. Direct interactions with other people, meanwhile, have been linked to boosts in mood and can even improve long-term health. The collaborative quest for connection, inspiration, and purpose is a powerful thing. It's what keeps the drum beating and shapes the soul. The Playwrights' Center is that soul, that drum for playwrights, and that is why I am here.” </p>

      <p>In fall 2014, the Playwrights’ Center launched an updated brand to better communicate our mission and more deeply engage with the playwrights we serve. We were fortunate to work with KNOCK, Inc.&mdash;longtime supporters of the Center. The first piece to feature our new brand was the 2014-15 season brochure, showcasing our public season and the year’s Core Writers and fellows. The new brand and website were made possible by a grant from the TCG A-ha! program and an anonymous foundation.</p>

        <p>The cornerstone of the new Playwrights’ Center brand is a custom typeface created for us by renowned type designer and friend of the Center <a href="http://www.mckltype.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Mickel</a>. The typeface is named Wilson, in honor of August Wilson, who was such a big part of the Playwrights’ Center in the 1980s, developing work such as The Piano Lesson here during his 12 years living in St. Paul. The layered headlines, built from a wide variety of font style and color combinations, celebrate the multitude of voices and artists who make up the Playwrights’ Center family.</p>
